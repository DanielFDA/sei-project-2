## Overview 

For my second project in General Assembly's Software Engineering course our task was to develop a web app with React and an existing API for which we decided to build an interactive random quote generator using NodeJS for the back-end, we had a time span of two days for this project.

## Installation

First we need to download the repository into our own machine for which we have to input the following line into our terminal or command line:
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/DanielFDA/sei-project-2.git
```
then you'll need to install dependencies running `yarn` in either the in-built terminal of your code editor or cmd/terminal, making sure you're inside the root of the project. The address on the terminal should look something like this
```bash 
~/GA/development/PROJECTS/sei-project-2
```
after that you can start the app with `yarn start`


## Technologies Used
* CSS
* JavaScript (ES6)
* HTML5
* React
* SASS

#### Dependencies
* Axios
* React-router-dom


## Conclusion
### Wins and Challenges

The biggest win for this project is the fact that despite it being the first time working with another developer the communication was pretty clear and we always had in mind what the other person was working on so our structure was pretty well defined and we were capable of achieving everything we considered for the MVP taking into account that we had just learned the basics of React.

My biggest challenge on this project was adapting to the short timeframe, maybe because our planning didn't really account for much styling unless we had the time, something that looking back we should've probably given more time but at the same time the goal was to learn as much React as we could and that's what we focused on. 

### Some Learnings

Most of the learning here was heavily oriented towards knowledge about either the technologies we used or the heavy lifting you can do if you set yourself up to it when you have a short window of time to make something from scratch. Didn't have much to time for specific cases or situations, almost all the time was spent learning how to do stuff and implementing it and fixing any bugs along the way

This project was one of those that teached me a lot about the basics of React and showed me that there was so much I didn't know about React and programming in general (looking back I'm even more bamboozled now) that kind of scared me in the beginning but also intrigued me a lot and made me want to spent as much time learning as I could, to be able to get to a comfortable level of React and programming in general.
